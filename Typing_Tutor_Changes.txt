CatchWord Class

In the CatchWord class two new methods have been created; lowerPos and checkDuplicates. These two methods are used in the run method. LowerPos takes two Falling words
as arguments, in then gets the y positions of the words and checks which of the two words has a greater y position, it dertemines which of the two words is lower than
the other. The lowerPos method then returns the word that has the greates y position, the word nearer the bottom of the screen.

The method checkDuplicates takes in an integer as an argument. It checks if there are duplicate words in the words array that match the target word. The integer that
is passed to it is used to determine where the first word that matches the target is, then a for loop looks through the rest of the array to find a match for the target
word. If there are duplicates in the words array a boolena true value is returned by the method.
